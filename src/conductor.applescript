(*
	Everything the relay drives Conductor's UI with, in one place.

	Loaded verbatim by src/writes.ts, which appends a few lines naming the
	handlers to run and hands the result to `osascript`. It lives in its own file
	rather than a TypeScript template literal for three reasons: an editor can
	highlight it, `yarn verify` can compile-check it (scripts/check-applescript.ts,
	which is the only automated test this code has), and a backtick in a comment
	no longer terminates the string it used to sit inside — so this sentence,
	which contains `one`, is now harmless.

	The target rides in on the environment (RELAY_WS_*, RELAY_TAB_*, RELAY_SET_*,
	RELAY_PROMPT_FILE) rather than being interpolated, which keeps AppleScript
	string escaping out of the picture entirely.

	Two traps to respect when editing:

	 - Inside a `tell application "System Events"` block, ordinary-looking variable
	   names resolve as System Events terms. `tabs` and `groups` become "every
	   tab/group of the process", so a loop over your own list quietly iterates the
	   wrong thing and the handler returns nothing. Keep logic outside the tell and
	   reach in through one-line helpers, or name the variables `strip` and `pane`.
	 - Every read is rooted at `window 1`, and Conductor keeps running with its
	   windows closed. Go through `requireWindow` / `webArea` so a window that
	   closed mid-run says so in words.

	How the chat targeting works, and why each step is here:

	`openViaDeepLink` normally selects the chat already, by id. The handlers below
	are what confirm that, and what still does the work for the fallback focus
	paths, which only reach the right workspace. A workspace holds several chats
	and Conductor keeps typing in whichever tab is already active, so a send
	addressed to a non-active chat would land in the wrong agent.

	Conductor's webview exposes its whole tree through macOS Accessibility. The
	chat strip is an AXTabGroup whose AXRadioButtons are the tabs (AXValue marks
	the selected one, AXPress switches to it and does *not* close the chat). The
	strip's order matches reads.listSessions (created_at ASC), so the caller
	addresses a tab by 1-based index and we cross-check the label.

	Three traps that targeting has to survive:

	 - The tabs are not the strip's direct children. Each sits one AXGroup deep and
	   is named for its own close action ("Close chat <title>"), while a "Close file
	   view" radio button, which is not a chat, *is* a direct child. Reading the
	   direct children and stopping there made every chat strip look like a one-tab
	   strip called "Close file view", which then lost the scoring below to the
	   terminal panel and failed every send with "chat tab 1 not found". So
	   `stripRadios` reads both levels and `chatTabs` keeps the "Close chat" ones.
	 - The terminal panel is an AXTabGroup too (radio buttons named Setup / Run /
	   Terminal 1), a sibling of the chat strip in the same pane. Picking "the first
	   tab group" would sometimes press a terminal tab, so candidates are *scored*
	   on tab count plus label and a tie refuses to act.
	 - The palette can land on the wrong workspace (a loose query matches a command;
	   a deleted branch opens a modal). The pane header carries the branch and repo,
	   so we read them back and bail if they disagree.

	Target is read from RELAY_TAB_{INDEX,COUNT,TITLE} and RELAY_WS_{BRANCH,REPO};
	index 0 disables the tab step. Every failure path errors out so the caller
	aborts *before* typing — landing in the wrong chat is worse than not sending.
