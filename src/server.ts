 * makes the first AppleScript run slow enough to be killed, and the second finds an
 * activated app and lands — which is exactly why tapping Retry always worked. Two
 * things make doing it automatically safe rather than a way to send a prompt twice:
 *  - **The transcript is the receipt.** Every run is followed by a full

 *    reported an error, and the last of those checks is the moment before we type
 *    again. A run that actually landed — even one killed just after pressing Enter,
 *    or one whose row appeared after we'd stopped looking — is reported as delivered.
 *  - **The composer is written, not appended to** (`fillComposer` sets AXValue), so a
 *    retry replaces a half-finished attempt's text instead of doubling it.
 *
 * Bounded by a wall clock rather than an attempt count, because someone is holding
 * this request open: runs are bounded by the caller's deadline, and we stop rather
 * than start one the budget could not also confirm. The queue's own 3-sends-over-15-
 * minutes schedule sits *outside* this and is unaffected — it retries a delivery that
 * never got off the ground (worktree still setting up), not one Conductor fumbled.
