/**
 * Push notifications: "your agent finished" on the lock screen.
 *
 * This is a *third* shape next to the reads/writes split in CLAUDE.md, and the
 * cheapest one — it is a **read that pushes**. Nothing here touches Conductor:
 * the trigger is a poll of the same read-only SQLite the list view uses, and the
 * delivery is an HTTPS POST to Apple/Google/Mozilla's push service. No
 * Accessibility, no AppleScript, no window has to exist. A Conductor update can
 * rename every UI string and notifications keep working.
 *
 * What counts as news is deliberately narrow — `sessions.status` is the only
 * signal Conductor records, and it holds four values (`working`, `idle`,
 * `error`, and the transient `needs_plan_response` — see `turnEnded`):
 * - `working → idle | needs_plan_response` — the turn ended. This is *the*
 *   event: it covers "done", "asked you a question", "plan ready" and "hit a
 *   permission prompt" alike, because each ends the turn.
 * - `→ error` — the agent stopped badly.
 * There is no permission-request table to watch (verified against the schema), so
 * don't go looking for a finer-grained *trigger*; there isn't one. The *wording* is
 * allowed one refinement: at fire time, `reads.pendingInput` (the transcript-tail
 * read) can say the turn ended on a question or a plan — one extra tail query per
 * notification, never per tick.
 *
 * Two properties worth keeping:
 * - **Transitions are confirmed one tick before they fire.** A status that
 *   flickers (a queued prompt starting the next turn immediately) would otherwise
 *   buzz a phone for a turn that never really ended.
 * - **The first tick after a device subscribes is a baseline, not a broadcast.**
 *   Every already-idle session on the Mac is not news; without this, enabling
 *   notifications would fire one per workspace.
