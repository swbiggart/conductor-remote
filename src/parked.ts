/**
 * Prompts parked because the Mac's screen is locked, delivered by the relay the
 * moment it unlocks.
 *
 * The lock screen hides the whole session's UI from Accessibility, so while it is
 * up no AppleScript write can land — and the phone's own retry budget (~a minute)
 * is the wrong tool for a wait that routinely lasts hours. So a send that hits
 * the lock hands its prompt to this queue and returns at once: the phone shows it
 * as a queued bubble in the chat (`workspace.parked_prompts` on `/api/state`),
 * the relay polls the lock and delivers when it lifts, and a push notification
 * says whether it landed. Same ownership story as `firstprompt.ts`: the relay is
 * the only deliverer, the phone only watches and can dismiss.
 *
 * The same three properties hold it up:
 *
 * - **One owner.** The phone never re-sends a parked prompt on its own; a manual
 *   send of the same text clears the entry server-side (`forgetDelivered`), so
 *   the two paths can't double it.
 * - **It survives a restart.** `autoupdate` exits to reload new code mid-wait as
 *   a matter of course; the JSON file brings the queue back with the process.
 * - **It gives up in public.** Time spent locked is free — a weekend away is not
 *   a failure — but once the Mac is unlocked, `MAX_ATTEMPTS` real delivery
 *   failures flip the entry to `failed` *and it stays*, text and reason visible
 *   on the phone, one Retry from going again.
